Hi all,

over the past years I have written a lot of PowerShell code for Microsoft System Center 2012 (R2) Configuration Manager.

A lot of this code made it onto this blog and some of it is even pretty popular (thanks guys!). However, with my recent change of jobs I have just got no time anymore to support any of those scripts.

This comes down to a couple of reasons:

  * not enough time
  * no test environment anymore
  * really, like really not my focus anymore

I am going to leave the code here on my blog of course, but it's also already on Github: https://github.com/davidobrien1985/ConfigMgr

Check here for the ConfigMgr 2012 R2 documentation script: https://github.com/davidobrien1985/ConfigMgr/blob/master/DocumentCM12R2v2.ps1

Go check it out. Fork it, make it better (some really need it!), get it out there and contribute back to the community.

I'm happy to respond to issues on Github or maybe fix some really obvious problems/bugs with my code.

You will see more of my content on other (more interesting?!) topics here of course, but also on www.powershellmagazine.com for example.
