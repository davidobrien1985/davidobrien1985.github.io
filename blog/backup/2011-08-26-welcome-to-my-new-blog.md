Welcome to my new blog which is going to deal with everything around VDI (mostly Citrix XenDesktop) and Microsoft's System Center Configuration Manager.

My personal goal is to not only spread news or write about things I'm working on, but also post some video tutorials which will hopefully help some of you at work or in your own lab environment.
