Yesterday, a colleague of mine told me about a new hydration kit for SCCM 2012 Beta 2, which is available here: <a href="http://www.deploymentresearch.com/Blog/tabid/62/EntryId/29/YAHK-Yet-Another-Hydration-Kit-This-one-for-ConfigMgr-2012-Beta-2.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.deploymentresearch.com/Blog/tabid/62/EntryId/29/YAHK-Yet-Another-Hydration-Kit-This-one-for-ConfigMgr-2012-Beta-2.aspx', 'Hydration Kit for SCCM 2012\n']);" target="_blank">Hydration Kit for SCCM 2012<br /> </a>

It has been designed to quickly deploy a standalone SCCM 2012 Beta 2 environment based on Hyper-V. The kit basically consists of some Powershell scripts which automatically create your machines and install the SCCM environment, so that you're ready to go as soon as the setup completes.

All you have to do is download the required sources and copy them to the right place.

This kit is really cool for quick presentations at a customer's site or even PoCs.
