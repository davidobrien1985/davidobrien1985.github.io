Alex Juschin (E2EVC) was quite a busy guy and just uploaded (nearly) all the videos of the last [E2EVC (Pubforum) 2013 in Copenhagen](/2013/05/27/live-from-e2evc-2013-copenhagen/).

I had two sessions there and if you weren't there or if you were and couldn't see me or want to see me again... here is the video:

## Automation of daily tasks in Microsoft System Center 2012 ConfigMgr with the help of Orchestrator and Service Manager

Unfortunately there went something wrong with the last 14min of the video and my display wasn't recorded anymore.
