This article I planned on writing for some time now (as a lot of others) but didn‚Äôt find the time yet. The topic itself isn‚Äôt new, it‚Äôs the solution that‚Äôs cool (although itself also not too new).

# Install Applications according to dynamic variable list {.}

There is more than one way of how you can install applications (and packages) during a Task Sequence and each of them has its pros and cons.

There is the ‚ÄúInstall Application‚Äù step which lets you chose the applications you want to have installed:

![image](/media/2015/01/1422405870_full.png)

This is really easy, as long as you don‚Äôt want to install more than nine (9) applications in one step.

![image](/media/2015/01/1422405911_full.png)

The tenth application you want to install needs to be put into a second ‚ÄúInstall Application‚Äù step.

Not too handy I would say.

The alternative?

Use a dynamic list to define which applications need to be installed. This concept is far from new, you might have already seen it being used with Packages in CM07. Here is a TechNet description of it: [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh846237.aspx#BKMK_InstallApplication](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh846237.aspx#BKMK_InstallApplication)

![image](/media/2015/01/1422405995_full.png)

I here now told the Task Sequence to install all Applications that are members of the dynamic variable list named ‚ÄúBasisVariable‚Äù. You can pick any name you like here.

In order for this to work now I need to deploy that Task Sequence to a collection and build that dynamic list. This is done via Collection variables.

If you don‚Äôt know how to work with Collection Variables, have a look at some previous articles of mine on that topic: [How do Variables in ConfigMgr work? Part 1](/2013/01/12/how-do-variables-in-configuration-manager-2012-work-part-1/) , [Part 2](/2013/01/13/how-do-variables-in-configuration-manager-2012-work-part-2/), [Part 3](/2013/01/15/how-do-variables-in-configuration-manager-2012-work-part-3/)

My collection now looks like this:

![image](/media/2015/01/1422406032_full.png)

I could continue this list up to 99 as long as I don‚Äôt break the count ‚Äì and that‚Äôs the tricky bit. The list might be good enough for some time, but what if you have to remove PDFCreator from that deployment?

PDFCreator is the value of the variable ‚ÄúBasisVariable03‚Äù and if you go ahead and just delete that variable then nothing else after ‚ÄúGoogleChrome‚Äù or ‚ÄúBasisVariable02‚Äù would be installed, regardless of how many variables would follow. All because the count is interrupted.

Then you say, well I just go and edit the variable names. Not possible üòâ You can‚Äôt edit the names of existing variables! Why? Don‚Äôt know. Stupid, right?

Only way to fix that is to delete ALL VARIABLES and rebuild the count from scratch. If you hate somebody really much, then give him or her that task üòâ

So, what now?

## ZTICoalesce.wsf from MDT {.}

Microsoft is aware of this problem. In fact, they already gave you a script to workaround this problem. The Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) offers you a script called [ZTICoalesce.wsf](http://systemscenter.ru/mdt2012.en/zticoalescewsf.htm) which takes the name of the Dynamic Variable List and repairs any gaps in the count.

That script is written in VBScript and I think VBScript is legacy and I‚Äôm really, I mean really, not good at it. That‚Äôs why I wanted to rebuild that whole ‚Äúrepair my dynamic variable list‚Äù into Powershell.

## Correct Dynamic Variable List via Powershell {.}

I wrote a script called Correct-BaseVars.ps1 which will accept two arguments on the commandline.

```
Argument 1: $NameOfBaseVariable
Argument 2: $LengthSuffix
```

The second argument should, for now (maybe forever) be 2. That‚Äôs because if you want to use a dynamic variable list with Applications, then you need to use a suffix with the length of 2. For Packages, which I ignored, that suffix has a length of 3. For the time being it‚Äôs always 2.

![image](/media/2015/01/1422406070_full.png)

I copied my script into my MDT Package in the Scripts folder, that way it will always be copied down to the client and I can call it via the %ScriptRoot% variable. If you are not using MDT (why not?), you can still call that script from any other package.

The script will also write a Logfile to the CCM Client Log path called CorrectBaseVars.Log

If anything goes wrong during install, have a look here if the variable screwed up.

Here‚Äôs an example of the Log:

![image](/media/2015/01/1422406104_full.png)

### Issues with the script

I didn‚Äôt find a way to delete the Base Variables from the client‚Äôs WMI namespace. It‚Äôs no problem at all to add new variables, but how do I delete them?

In my example the list will end up with orphaned entries at the end of the list. These shouldn‚Äôt cause any problems or multiple content download as each application will check, because that‚Äôs the way they work, if it needs to be installed (Detection Methods). In this case, if there is more than one entry for an application, the second entry won‚Äôt fire off.

Anyway, it feels nicer if one could delete the entry entirely. Any ideas?

Download the script here: [correct-BaseVars](/media/2014/01/correct-BaseVars.zip)

Here‚Äôs the script:

```
<#
        Function: This script will fix any issues with gaps in a dynamic variable list used to install ConfigMgr / SCCM applications.
        Usage: .\correct-BaseVars.ps1 $NameOfBaseVariable $LengthSuffix
        $LengthSuffix should usually be 2 if you use Applications
