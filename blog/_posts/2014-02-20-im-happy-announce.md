In my December’s article ["End of year 2013"](http://www.david-obrien.net/2013/12/12/end-year-new-change/) I teased you all by saying that my wife and I are going to move away from Germany, but I couldn’t tell you back then where exactly we are going as there were still some uncertainties (visa and such).

Finally today I am happy to tell you that from March 15 on (so less than a month) I will be starting my new position at **Dilignet** ([www.dilignet.com](http://www.dilignet.com)).[<img style="margin-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Dilignet MAPA Award" alt="Dilignet MAPA Award" src="http://www.david-obrien.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/image_thumb5.png" width="274" height="47" align="right" border="0" />]("Dilignet MAPA Award" http://www.david-obrien.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/image5.png)

Dilignet’s value lies in its uniqueness in the marketplace – being specialised, with a deep skill set and understanding of the integration of the Microsoft Management and Virtualisation technologies.

Yes, you read correctly, Australia  <img src="http://www.david-obrien.net/David/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />We are moving to Melbourne/Victoria!

I am very much excited about this move and I’m really looking forward to working for Dilignet.

These are very exciting times for me and my wife with still a lot to organize, but we are so happy that all worked out fine!

I will still blog, tweet and mail you all, from next month on only a few time zones ahead
