The next week will be full of interesting online and in-person community events all over the Australia / Asia / Pacific region with loads of interesting sessions around Windows Client, Server, Office 365, Azure and Visual Studio.

MVPs from nine (9) countries will deliver these webinars and in-person seminars, so make sure you don't miss them!

I myself will be at the in-person seminar in Melbourne on Saturday 22nd and try to learn a bit about O365 ðŸ˜‰

In Australia alone there are in-person seminars in 5 cities (Perth, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Melbourne).
