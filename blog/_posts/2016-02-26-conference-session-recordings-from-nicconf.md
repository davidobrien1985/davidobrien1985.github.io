This year I was able to again make the long trip to Europe to present at the [Nordic Infrastructure Conference NicConf](http://www.nicconf.com) in Oslo/Norway.

I had two sessions, one was "Ansible - Configuration Management on Linux" and the other one was "PowerShell on AWS".

Here are the session recordings, I hope you enjoy watching them as much as I enjoyed doing the sessions. If you've been there, thank you and hopefully see you next year again!
