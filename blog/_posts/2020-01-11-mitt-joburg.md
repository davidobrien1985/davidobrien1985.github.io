2020 is already starting strong with interesting customer projects, but also my first trip to the continent of Africa to speak at [Microsoft Ignite The Tour - Johannesburg](https://www.microsoft.com/en-za/ignite-the-tour/johannesburg).

> Sandton Convention Centre, Johannesburg, South Africa 
> January 30â€“31, 2020

I have two breakout sessions prepared for this event, of course talking about my favourite topic, cloud operations.<br>
One rather technical session focussing on how the day to day management tasks of System Administrators can be even more secured in the Azure cloud.<br>

`Say no to RDP and SSH! Can we?` - [BRK30180](https://johannesburg.myignitetour.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/91131?source=sessions)

The second session focusses on higher level principles that will surely help to make your migration project to Azure successful.<br>

`Not your other datacenter - 10 tips for a successful Azure migration` - [BRK30181](https://johannesburg.myignitetour.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/91132?source=sessions)

Are you going to be there as well or are you planning to attend a Microsoft Ignite The Tour event at one of the other 30 cities worldwide?
