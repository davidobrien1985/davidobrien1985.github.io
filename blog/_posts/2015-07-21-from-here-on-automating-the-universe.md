So, it was really quiet here over the last two months and that had several reasons. I will talk about one of them now.

I am changing, again. Or reinventing myself? Innovating myself? Whatever, I am changing jobs. Today was my last day at Dilignet and from tomorrow on I will be working for [Monitor Consulting](http://www.monitorconsulting.com.au/), part of the Davidson Group ([http://www.davidsonwp.com](http://www.davidsonwp.com)) in Melbourne as a "Senior Consultant - Infrastructure / DevOps".

My focus will finally shift away from Client Management to automation and Cloud Infrastructure with a main focus on Microsoft technologies, but obviously going to broaden my views from here on.

I am very excited about this opportunity and are looking forward to a lot of new and exciting projects.

Expect more activity again in the coming months.
