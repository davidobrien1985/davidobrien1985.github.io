The format will be quite different to what it used to be. Instead of four days on the Gold Coast it will now be split into two 2-day events in Sydney and Melbourne. I will have the pleasure to speak at both locations.

# Datacenter transformation

My two sessions will be &#8211; who would&#8217;ve guessed- around automation. My two sessions will be:

  * _Be in total control with Desired State Configuration (Sydney, October 27-28 2014)_ 
      * _Bye-bye Orchestrator, there&#8217;s a new kid in town (Melbourne, October 7-82014)_ </ul> 
    The exact times of the two sessions are not yet available, but the agenda should be published quite soon.
    
    ## Wishes? Comments?
    
    There&#8217;s still time for you to ask me to cover some things you would like to see in my sessions. I&#8217;m all about community and interaction with the community, so if you have any comments or wishes, then please let me know as soon as possible and I will try to implement them into my sessions.
