# SMS\_ADMIN\_UI\_PATH and SMS\_LOG_PATH

This is a quick one, because I just stumbled upon these two Powershell environment variables on a Site System Server (with installed Admin console)

The following variable will resolve to the local path where the ConfigMgr 2012 Admin Console is installed to:

![SMS_ADMIN_UI_PATH](/media/2013/05/image.png)

This variable will resolve to the local path where the ConfigMgr 2012 logfiles are stored to:

![SMS_LOG_PATH](/media/2013/05/image1.png)

## Variables for automation in ConfigMgr 2012

These variables are great for automation purposes, as we donâ€™t have to go into registry anymore to look for the Admin console path and then import the Powershell module or register com-objects, we just use this variable.

I will definitely rewrite my scripts to use these variables.
