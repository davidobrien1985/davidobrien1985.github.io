In case you don’t know what E2EVC is, then go have a look at [www.e2evc.com](http://www.e2evc.com). It’s from 31.May to 02.June 2013. You might remember the PubForum? That’s it!

# Sessions at E2EVC

After visiting E2EVC the first time last year in Vienna and doing one session about “Automating Application compatibility tests and App-V sequencing with AppDNA” I thought to myself, “hey, that went so well, why not do it again?” (and learn through presenting and talking to the great minds of our community!)

So I’m happy to announce that I’ll be doing two (2) sessions in Copenhagen.

Session 1:

Early Bird Saturday 08:15-08:55 Installation automatisation for XenApp, XenDesktop and other Citrix Products

Session 2:

Sunday 10:00-10:45 Automatisation of daily Tasks in Microsoft System Center ConfigMgr with help of Orchestrator and Service Manager (SCSM)

I’m already very excited to speak at E2EVC again and meet all those I met last year and new people from all around the globe!

Like last year, I’ll try to do a “live ticker” from the event to keep you updated.
