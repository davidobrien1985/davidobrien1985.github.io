# AWS Simple Systems Manager for EC2: Getting Started

I am happy to announce the availability of my next Pluralsight training course. <br>

## Who this course is for

This course is for you if you manage Virtual Machines on AWS EC2 or any other form of infrastructure on Amazon Web Services. <br>
However, even if the majority of your infrastructure is still on-premises or even hosted on another cloud platform this course will have something for you.

[https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/aws-ssm-ec2-getting-started](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/aws-ssm-ec2-getting-started) <br>
<br>
You will learn about lots of very important things like patching VMs, secret management, managing state on VMs and checking compliance against your corporate baselines, and all of that without deploying a single management VM, completely serverless so to speak.

Not even two hours of your time, that's all it takes. Looking forward to your feedback.
