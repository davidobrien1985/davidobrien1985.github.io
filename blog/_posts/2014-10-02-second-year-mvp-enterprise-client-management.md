Today I got the probably most important email in October 2014. On the day that Microsoft announced Windows 10, Microsoft re-awarded me for the second time with a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional Award for Enterprise Client Management. This expertise includes Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr / SCCM) and Intune / MDM.

I am very thankful for this award and couldn't have achieved all this without my always understanding wife Sandra. Becoming an MVP means working late, travelling to events (most of them on the weekends) and mainly doing stuff non-IT people consider 'work' and as such think is a waste of time <img class="img-responsive wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" style="border-style: none;" src="/media/2014/10/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile.png" alt="Winking smile" />

I'm looking forward to another very exciting year for me personally here in Australia and also professionally with all that is coming in theWindows, System Center, and Powershell area.
