Today I got the probably most important email in October 2014. On the day that Microsoft announced Windows 10, Microsoft re-awarded me for the second time with a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional Award for Enterprise Client Management. This expertise includes Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr / SCCM) and Intune / MDM.

I am very thankful for this award and couldn&#8217;t have achieved all this without my always understanding wife Sandra. Becoming an MVP means working late, travelling to events (most of them on the weekends) and mainly doing stuff non-IT people consider &#8216;work&#8217; and as such think is a waste of time <img class="img-responsive wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" style="border-style: none;" src="http://www.david-obrien.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile.png" alt="Winking smile" />

I&#8217;m looking forward to another very exciting year for me personally here in Australia and also professionally with all that is coming in theWindows, System Center, and Powershell area.
