**[/UPDATE]**

If you haven't heard about it already, the Cloud OS MVP Roadshow, a worldwide event hosted by Microsoft, will come to Sydney in August 2014.

I will be speaking there alongside other MVPs about how to get you away from that old, stinking, legacy Windows Server 2003, to the new, shiny, with a smell of roses Windows Server 2012 R2.

Here is another good write-up about previous Cloud OS Roadshow events: <http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/story/Cloud%20OS%20MVP%20Roadshow-20140324162819>

Looking forward to seeing you in Sydney!
