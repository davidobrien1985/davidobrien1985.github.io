I am very happy and proud to announce that for another year I was awarded with the prestigious [Microsoft Most Valuable Professional](https://mvp.microsoft.com/) MVP award.<br>
This award regonises exceptional community leadership in and around the Microsoft Azure ecosystem.

If you follow me on any social media or have been to any of my conference talks you will know that my biggest focus for all my customers is on maximum automation, security, robust cloud infrastructure and mature tooling.<br>
I am very glad that the global Microsoft Azure Product Team recognises my approach as valid and helps me through this award to spread this message further into the Azure community.<br>
I am looking forward to continue helping community members all over the world and my customers here in Australia and overseas to be successful on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform.<br>
