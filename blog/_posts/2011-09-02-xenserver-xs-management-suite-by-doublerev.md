Just came across a nice tool for all the XenServer admins which will let you complete some tasks faster and easier.

"XS-Management Suite" by DoubleRev is a Management tool which integrates into your XenCenter and can be downloaded at DoubleRev's website as a 15-day trial.

This suite has some nice features like

* Eject all mounted virtual CD/DVDs
* network topology
* VM inventory
* VM Manager
* quick designation of new Pool Master

Personally, I think it comes at quite a price, but just looked at its features, it's really cool.

There are also some more free tools on their site:Â [http://www.doublerev.com/](http://www.doublerev.com/)
