Just came across a nice tool for all the XenServer admins which will let you complete some tasks faster and easier.

"XS-Management Suite" by DoubleRev is a Management tool which integrates into your XenCenter and can be downloaded at DoubleRev's website as a 15-day trial.

This suite has some nice features like

  * Eject all mounted virtual CD/DVDs
  * network topology
  * VM inventory
  * VM Manager
  * quick designation of new Pool Master<figure id="attachment_140" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width: 300px">

Personally, I think it comes at quite a price, but just looked at its features, it's really cool.

There are also some more free tools on their site:Â [http://www.doublerev.com/](http://www.doublerev.com/)
