After getting rid of my [Surface earlier this year ](http://www.david-obrien.net/2015/01/bye-bye-windows-hello-mac/)there’s another big change for me, I’m saying good-bye to the Enterprise Client Management Group and with immediate effect am now a “System Center Cloud and Datacenter Management"
  
(SCCDM) MVP.

My [MVP Profile](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/David%20O%27Brien-5000267) has already been updated accordingly.

# Cloud and Datacenter Management MVP {.}

This has already been on my mind for some time. I’m still going to do and blog about ConfigMgr, but my focus will clearly stay on Cloud and Datacenter **AUTOMATION,** because that is what I do, in my free time, when speaking at events and of course at work. <img src="http://www.david-obrien.net/David/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Even more exciting times ahead!
