I'm happy to share with you that the UK based recruiting and consulting company [Nigel Frank](https://www.nigelfrank.com) have included me in their recent line up of the top 20 Azure Influencers on Twitter.<br>
I have to say I'm in very good company with the likes of other MVPs but also [Mark Russinovich](https://twitter.com/markrussinovich) (Microsoft Azure CTO).<br>
Check out the full list [here](https://www.nigelfrank.com/blog/top-20-microsoft-azure-influencers-on-twitter/) and also follow me on Twitter [@david_obrien](https://twitter.com/david_obrien).
