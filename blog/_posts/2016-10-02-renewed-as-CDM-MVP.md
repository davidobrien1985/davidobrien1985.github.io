# Renewed as Microsoft MVP for Cloud and Datacentre Management

Is it October again? A year has passed already and last night, shortly before midnight local time Melbourne/Australia, I received the email every Microsoft MVP awaits on his or her date of renewal.

This is the fourth consecutive year I have been awarded Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) and I'm truly thankful.
My focus has obviously shifted a bit from when I started and the program has also changed, but I am still happy to be part of such a professional community of experts in their fields.
There are only 455 Cloud and Datacentre MVPs in the world and of those only eleven in [Australia](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/MvpSearch?ex=Cloud+and+Datacenter+Management&lo=Australia&sc=s).

To me being a Microsoft MVP means that my hard work and feedback is appreciated by Microsoft and to be able to reach out to every single other MVP and get an answer to a question.

I'm looking forward to the upcoming MVP Summit in November and what the next year will hold for me and also for Microsoft.

Cheers!
