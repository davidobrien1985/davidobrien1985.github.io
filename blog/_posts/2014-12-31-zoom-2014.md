2014 felt a bit like that. So much happened the last 12 months it’s hard not to forget something.

* had a session at User Group in Zurich / Switzerland
* quit my job at sepago, after 5 great years
* **moved to Australia!!!**
* **I frigging moved to Australia!!!**
* met a lot of great people here.
* had a session at TechEd Australia in Melbourne
* had a session at TechEd Australia in Sydney
* Went to my first MVP Summit (Redmond / Washington / USA) ever
* had 5 (or was it 6?) sessions at MMS Minnesota
  * sharing the stage with great guys like [Jeff Wouters,](http://jeffwouters.nl/) [Trevor Sullivan](http://trevorsullivan.net) and [Greg Ramsey](http://gregramsey.net)
* had 2 sessions at the Brisbane Infrastructure User Group
    * shared one session with [James Bannan](http://jamesbannanit.com/)

I can’t wait to see what 2015 has in store for me. I already know a couple of things like NicConf (Oslo, Norway) in February and we’re getting a dog, but there will be so much more and I am really looking forward to it.

Coming to Australia was a big move for me (and my wife!), but it was totally worth it. We got a lot of support from people we met over here (especially James, thank you!), without whom this little adventure of ours would not have been such a great experience so far.

Thank you also to you, the reader of my blog, no matter if you are a returning reader or here for the first time. Thank you very much and I’m looking forward to welcome you back here in 2015!

Cheers,
