2014 felt a bit like that. So much happened the last 12 months it’s hard not to forget something.

  * had a session at User Group in Zurich / Switzerland
  * quit my job at sepago, after 5 great years
  * **moved to Australia!!!**
  * **I frigging moved to Australia!!!**
  * met a lot of great people here.
  * had a session at TechEd Australia in Melbourne
  * had a session at TechEd Australia in Sydney
  * Went to my first MVP Summit (Redmond / Washington / USA) ever
  * had 5 (or was it 6?) sessions at MMS Minnesota 
      * sharing the stage with great guys like <a href="http://jeffwouters.nl/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://jeffwouters.nl/', 'Jeff Wouters,']);" target="_blank">Jeff Wouters,</a> <a href="http://trevorsullivan.net" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://trevorsullivan.net', 'Trevor Sullivan']);" target="_blank">Trevor Sullivan</a> and <a href="http://gregramsey.net" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gregramsey.net', 'Greg Ramsey']);" target="_blank">Greg Ramsey</a>

I can’t wait to see what 2015 has in store for me. I already know a couple of things like NicConf (Oslo, Norway) in February and we’re getting a dog, but there will be so much more and I am really looking forward to it.

Coming to Australia was a big move for me (and my wife!), but it was totally worth it. We got a lot of support from people we met over here (especially James, thank you!), without whom this little adventure of ours would not have been such a great experience so far.

Thank you also to you, the reader of my blog, no matter if you are a returning reader or here for the first time. Thank you very much and I’m looking forward to welcome you back here in 2015!

Cheers,
