# Building an Azure Continuous Integration Pipeline with VSTS

Over the last 3 months now I was busy working on my very first [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com) course. <br>
I am very happy to announce that this course has now been published. <br>

[https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/azure-continuous-integration-pipeline-building](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/azure-continuous-integration-pipeline-building) <br>
<br>
The course uses [Visual Studio Team Services](https://wwww.visualstudio.com) and a lot of Continuous Integration concepts to deploy infrastructure on Microsoft Azure.<br>
If you are not on Azure, don't worry, still check it out, it's quite conceptual but filled with demos.<br>
Two hours of your time, that's all it takes.
