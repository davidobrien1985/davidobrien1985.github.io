I already wrote something about the [Hydration Kit for Beta 2]("PoC Deployment of SCCM 2012 â€“ Hydration Kit" http://www.david-obrien.de/?p=143), but now Johan Arwidmark just released his Hydration Kit for the System Center Configuration Manager 2012 RC2.

He claims that a functional lab environment can now be built in under 2 hours. (it usually works! ;)

Download it at [http://www.deploymentresearch.com/Blog/tabid/62/EntryId/49/The-Hydration-Kit-for-ConfigMgr-2012-RC2-is-available-for-download.aspx](http://www.deploymentresearch.com/Blog/tabid/62/EntryId/49/The-Hydration-Kit-for-ConfigMgr-2012-RC2-is-available-for-download.aspx) and start testing it!
