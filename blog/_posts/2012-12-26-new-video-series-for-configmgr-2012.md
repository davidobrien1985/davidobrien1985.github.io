# Video Tutorials how to use my Powershell Scripts in SCCM 2012

I’m starting a new video series where I’m going to show you how to use the scripts I write. Of course this can also be seen as a beginners guide to ConfigMgr 2012, as I ‘m also explaining some basic stuff.

This is quite some work compared to just writing about what you do, recording and stuff like that is new to me.

Hope you like my videos and remember, “sharing is caring”  ;-) >So share my content if you like it!
