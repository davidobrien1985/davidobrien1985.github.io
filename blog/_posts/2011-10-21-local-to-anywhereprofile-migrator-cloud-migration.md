[Citrix](http://www.citrix.com) Synergy is just about to start and I thought I could talk a bit about Profile Migrator, as it’s part of Citrix’s Desktop Transformation Model.

In this scenario I am going to show you in a quick demonstration how fast and easy you can actually migrate a local Windows XP user to a XenDesktop based Windows 7 user.

Your clients will thank you if you know about this.

Have fun, and btw: it IS weird to hear your own voice.
