After [Vienna in 2012](/2012/05/27/im-at-e2evc-2012-in-vienna-live-feed-2/) and [Copenhagen this June](/2013/05/27/live-from-e2evc-2013-copenhagen/), this will be my third time visiting and also speaking at E2EVC conference. This will also be my first speaking engagement as Microsoft MVP :-)

[E2EVC (Experts to Experts Virtualization Conference)](http://www.e2evc.com) is a non-commercial, community-driven virtualization event. It started out 10 years ago as Pubforum and repeated itself twice a year in a different european city.

At E2EVC IT Pros from all over Europe and even the World come together for a weekend (Friday to Sunday) full of presentations, Master Classes and talks.

Here you get the chance to talk to vendors and experts with your favourite beverage in hand and just have a great time!

It’s all about virtualization and what goes with it. Presentations around Microsoft, Citrix, RES, VMware or any other cool product or community tool can be found here. Just have a look at the agenda for this event in Rome on [WWW.E2EVC.COM](http://www.E2EVC.COM)
