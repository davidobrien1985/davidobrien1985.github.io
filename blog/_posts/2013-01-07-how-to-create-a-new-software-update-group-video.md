# Creating a new Software Update Group in ConfigMgr 2012

This video is a demonstration of my script which I wrote in December 2012 ([Create a new Software Update Group in ConfigMgr](/2012/12/02/create-a-new-software-update-group-in-configmgr/), [/2012/12/02/create-a-new-software-update-group-in-configmgr/](/2012/12/02/create-a-new-software-update-group-in-configmgr/)).

I tweaked the script a bit in order to support some more features, which some people and I myself whished for.
