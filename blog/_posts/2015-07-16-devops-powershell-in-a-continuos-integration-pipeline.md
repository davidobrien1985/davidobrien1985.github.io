This is a recording of my 20mins session at the last Melbourne System Center, Infrastructure and Security User Group.

It is a quick dive into PowerShell Desired State Configuration (PSDSC), Pester Unit Testing, Source Control with Gitlab, a Continuous Integration TeamCity server and a short intro into NuGet Package Management. This all falls under the big topic DevOps.

This video is more a teaser of what can be done, it's not a complete guide (those will follow), nor did I talk about every single aspect of it. Also I might have missed a couple of steps here because of time constraints.

Enjoy the recording and comments are obviously most welcome.
