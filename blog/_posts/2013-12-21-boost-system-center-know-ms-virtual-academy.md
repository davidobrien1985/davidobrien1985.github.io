If, over the upcoming days off, you find some spare time and want to learn a bit more on Microsoft System Center 2012 (R2), why not go and have a look at the [Microsoft Virtual Academy](www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/product-training/system-center#?mtag=MVP5000267)?

I did quite a lot over there while starting off on System Center myself and I still recommend it to all my customers who are new to System Center.

There are 30 courses on System Center 2012 and only 5 on System Center 2012 R2 at the moment, but I bet more will come.

Courses range from Level 100 (Beginner) to Level 300 (Advanced) and contain of different modules with videos, slides, little exams to test your knowledge and lots of information.
