Hey everybody, welcome to my blog! Great to see you here and I hope you like what you read until now. What about me? <br>
My name is David O'Brien, born 1985, married and I am the founder of [ARGOS Cloud Security](https://argos-security.io), a cloud security product for consultants and analysts that helps with quick, accurate, and detailed cloud security and compliance assessments.<br> 
My fields of interest are mainly everything around cloud security, automation and architecture.<br>
When I don't work I try to spend as much time as possible with my wife and son traveling the world or up in the air flying above it. If you would like to get in touch with me, just send me a tweet [@david_obrien](https://twitter.com/david_obrien) or use the comment function below my articles!
