Hey everybody, welcome to my blog! Great to see you here and I hope you like what you read until now. What about me? My name is David O&#8217;Brien, born &#8217;85,  married and I am a Senior DevOps / Automation / Cloud Engineer at Monitor Consulting in Melbourne Australia. My fields of interest are mainly everything around automation, especially Windows Powershell. When I don&#8217;t work I try to spend as much time as possible with my wife traveling the world or up in the air flying above it. If you would like to get in touch with me, just send me a tweet (@david_obrien) or use the comment function below my articles!
